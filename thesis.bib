  abstract = {We develop and investigate a particle-based model for ski slope traffic. Skiers are modeled as particles with a mass that are exposed to social and physical forces, which define the riding behavior of skiers during their descents on ski slopes. We also report position and speed data of 21 skiers recorded with GPS-equipped cell phones on two ski slopes. A comparison of these data with the trajectories resulting from computer simulations of our model shows a good correspondence. A study of the relationship among the density, speed, and flow of skiers reveals that congestion does not occur even with arrival rates of skiers exceeding the maximum ski lift capacity. In a sensitivity analysis, we identify the kinetic friction coefficient of skis on snow, the skier mass, the range of repelling social forces, and the arrival rate of skiers as the crucial parameters influencing the simulation results. Our model allows for the prediction of speed zones and skier densities on ski slopes, which is important in the prevention of skiing accidents.},

@article{hel2008,
    abstract = {{It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if
they would be subject to ``social forces.'' These ``forces'' are not
directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are
a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform
certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is
discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of
other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several
force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration
towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a
pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders;
and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations
of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer
simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social
force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several
observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.}},
