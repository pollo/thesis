\chapter{The model}\label{model}
The model implemented was proposed by Holleczek and Troster \cite{hol2012}. It can be classified as a two-dimensional microscopic-driven many-particle system with the constraint that skiers are exposed to gravity and centripetal forces.

The skiers are modeled as particles with a specific mass, $m$, that are exposed to forces. The model distinguishes between two kind of forces: the physical forces are those forces that regulate the skier motion determining the acceleration while the social forces determine the skiers behavior. The position of a particular skier at time $t$ is represented by the vector $r(t)$, $\dot{r}(t)=\frac{d}{dt}r(t)$ is his or her speed and $e_{\dot{r}}(t)=\ \dot{r}(t) / \Vert \dot{r}(t)\Vert$ the direction of motion.

\section{Social forces}
The social forces model the decisions made by a skier that is descending a slope. They are used to determine whether the skier should perform a turn, however they do not act on the acceleration. The social forces are dimensionless, the superposition of all the forces, $F_{social}$, gives the desired direction of the skier $e_{social}(t)=F_{social} / \Vert F_{social} \Vert$. If the desired direction $e_{social}(t)$ diverges from the skier direction $e_{\dot{r}}(t)$ more than an angle ${\delta}$ the skier start turning to adjust his or her direction (see Fig.\ref{start_turn_pic}).The social forces are used to model the repulsion from the edges and the obstacles, the repulsion from other skiers and to attract the skiers towards the destination chosen.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/start_turn_pic.eps}
    \caption{(From \cite{hol2012}) When the angle between the current direction of motion $e_{\dot{r}}$ and the desired direction $e_{social}$ is bigger than $\delta$ the skier performs a turn to adjust his or her direction}\label{start_turn_pic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To describe the social force that attracts the skier towards the destination chosen the model assumes that each skier, during the descent, selects several waypoints as temporary destinations. Thus, at each time $t$ the skier $a$ wants to reach the waypoint $x_a$. The direction toward the current waypoint is expressed by

\begin{equation}\label{waypoint_direction}
e_a(t)=\frac{x^k_a-r_a(t)}{\Vert x^k_a-r_a(t) \Vert}
\end{equation}

where, as defined in cap.\ref{model}, $r_a(t)$ is the position of $a$ at time $t$. The social force that drives the skier toward the waypoint, the destination force, is

\begin{equation}\label{destination_force}
F_D(r_a)=A_0 e_a(t)
\end{equation}

where $A_0$ is a scaling constant that represents the strength of the destination force.

The attitude of the skiers to keep a minimum distance from the edges is modeled with repulsion forces that are more stronger when the skier is closer to the edge. At each position $r_a$ the skier $a$ is subjected to a repulsion force from the left edge and to a repulsion force from the right edge. Let $r_a^L$ be the closest location to $r_a$ on the left edge, then the distance between the skier and the edge can be expressed as $r_{aL}=r_a-r_A^L$. The repulsion force from the left edge is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{left_force}
F_L(r_{aL})=-\nabla_{r_{aL}}U(\Vert r_{aL} \Vert )
\end{equation}

where $U(\Vert r_{aL} \Vert )$ is a monotonically decreasing potential. In a symmetric way the repulsion force from the right edge can be defined as

\begin{equation}\label{right_force}
F_R(r_{aR})=-\nabla_{r_{aR}}U(\Vert r_{aR} \Vert )
\end{equation}

The model takes into account also the natural behavior of avoiding collisions with other skiers. This is described by a repulsion force, referred as skier repulsion force, that each skier imposes on the other skiers. The skier repulsion force that a skier $b$ imposes on the skier $a$ can be expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{skier_force}
F_S(r_{ab})=-\nabla_{r_{ab}}V(s(r_{ab}))
\end{equation}

where $r_{ab}=r_a-r_b$ is the distance between the two skiers, $V(s(r_{ab}))$ is a monotonically decreasing potential with equipotential lines shaped as ellipses directed into the direction of motion and $s$ represents the semiminor axis of this ellipse and is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{skier_s}
s(r_{ab})=\frac{\sqrt{(\Vert r_{ab} \Vert + \Vert r_{ab}-v_b \Delta t e_b \Vert )^2-(v_b \Delta t)^2}}{2}
\end{equation}

Finally a repulsion force from the obstacles on the slope is considered. The force that an obstacle $o$ imposes on the skier $a$ is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{obstacle_force}
F_O(r_{ao})=-\nabla_{r_{ao}}W(\Vert r_{ao} \Vert )
\end{equation}

In general, the repulsion social forces act on the skiers only if he or she is capable of perceiving what triggers the force. The model assumes that objects are perceived only within a certain range $\varphi$ of the skier direction. $2\varphi$ can be considered as the angle of view. This is modeled by the weight

\begin{equation}\label{visibility}
w(u,v)=\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{$if(u/\Vert u \Vert)\cdot (v/\Vert v \Vert) \geq cos \varphi$} \\
  0 & \text{otherwise }
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

To summarize, the social forces that applies on a skier $a$ are
\begin{align}\label{social_forces_tb}
F_D(r_a)&=A_0 e_a(t),\\
F_L(\dot{r_a},r_{aL})&=w(\dot{r_a},-r_{aL})F_L(r_{aL}),\\
F_R(\dot{r_a},r_{aR})&=w(\dot{r_a},-r_{aR})F_R(r_{aR}),\\
F_A(\dot{r_a},r_{ab})&=w(\dot{r_a},-r_{ab})F_A(r_{ab}),\\
F_O(\dot{r_a},r_{ao})&=w(\dot{r_a},-r_{ao})F_O(r_{ao})
\end{align}

The resultant social force $F^a_{social}$ for a skier $a$ is the superposition of all the social forces that apply on the skier:

\begin{equation}
F^a_{social}=F_D(r_a)+F_L(\dot{r_a},r_{aL})+F_R(\dot{r_a},r_{aR})+\sum_b F_A(\dot{r_a},r_{ab})+\sum_o F_O(\dot{r_a},r_{ao})\nonumber
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{social_forces_diagram} shows a diagram of the social forces described above.

\section{Physical forces}
As described in \cite{hol2012}, there are two major techniques of performing turns: \textit{skidding} and \textit{carving}. During carving turns the direction of motion is exclusively parallel to the skis while in skidded turns there is an additional slippage to the side. Carved turns are usually performed by expert skiers, while beginners and not experienced skiers tend to perform skidded turns.

In \cite{hol2012} skiers are supposed to perform turns with a radius corresponding to the \textit{sidecut radius} of their skis. Although some studies \cite{jen2004} \cite{fe2010} have proposed a more realistic model of carving turns, investigating more deeply the effects of the penetration of the skis in the snow and of the skier tilt angle, for a first version of the model the approximation of the turning radius to the sidecut radius has been considered acceptable. Figure \ref{sidecut_radius} shows the relation between sidecut radius and turning radius.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/sidecut_radius.eps}
    \caption{(from \cite{hol2012}) Profile of a carving sking with the sidecut radius and the turning radius evidenced.}\label{sidecut_radius}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Gravitational, centripetal and friction forces determine the skier acceleration according to their direction $e_{\dot{r}}$. Consider a skier at position $r$ with speed $\dot{r}$ and direction of motion $e_{\dot{r}}$ and let $n$ denote the surface normal on the ski slope at $r$. At $r$, the slope has an inclination angle of

\begin{equation}
\alpha =\arccos(\left[0,0,1\right] \cdot n)
\end{equation}

and the inclination angle $\gamma$ of the current trajectory $e_{\dot{r}}$ is

\begin{equation}
\gamma =\arcsin[(\sin \alpha )(\sin \beta )]
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the angle between $e_{\dot{r}}$ and the horizontal of the slope.

To compute the force accelerating the skier the gravitational force, the friction forces and the centripetal forces should be investigated. First the gravitational force $F_G$ is considered: it can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
F_G=mg\left[\begin{matrix}0\\0\\-1\end{matrix}\right]
\end{equation}

where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and $m$ the mass of the skier. The gravitational force can be decomposed in the normal force $F_N$, acting parallel to the surface normal $n$, and in the downhill force $F_S$, acting parallel to the fall line.

\begin{equation}\label{downhill_force}
F_G=F_S-F_N
\end{equation}

The normal force $F_N$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
F_N=mg(\cos \alpha )n
\end{equation}

The downhill force $F_S$ itself can be decomposed into the downhill force $F_P$, acting parallel to the current trajectory $e_{\dot{r}}$, and the lateral force $F_{lat}$ acting perpendicularly to the direction of travel (see. fig\ref{downhill_force_pic}).

\begin{equation}
F_S=F_P+F_{lat}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/figure5.eps}
    \caption{(from \cite{hol2012}) The downhill force $F_S$ can be decomposed into the downhill force $F_P$, acting parallel to the current trajectory, and into the lateral force $F_{lat}$ acting perpendicularly to the direction of travel.}\label{downhill_force_pic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The downhill force $F_p$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
F_P=mg ( \sin \gamma ) e_{\dot{r}}=mg ( \sin \alpha ) ( \sin \beta ) e_{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is the inclination angle of $e_{\dot{r}}$.

Remembering \ref{downhill_force}, the downhill force $F_S$ can be computed as
\begin{equation}
F_S=F_G+F_N
\end{equation}

The lateral force $F_{lat}$ can therefore be computed as

\begin{equation}
F_{lat}=F_S-F_P
\end{equation}

The centripetal force $F_C$ a skier is exposed to during turns can be written as

\begin{equation}
F_C=\frac{m}{R_{SC}} {\norm{\dot{r}}}^2 \frac{F_{lat}}{\norm{F_{lat}}} \times
\begin{cases}
  (+1) & \text{before crossing the fall line} \\
  (-1) & \text{after crossing the fall line}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $m$ is the mass of the skier and $R_{SC}$ the sidecut radius of the skis. $F_C$ is parallel to $F_{lat}$ before the skier crosses the fall line and antiparallel to $F_{lat}$ after having crossed the fall line.

To define the kinetic friction of skis on snow, the effective force should be defined. The effective force is the force that has to be compensated by the snow. Its formulation depends on whether the skiers is performing a turn or is descending on a straight line. In the following, when the definition of a force changes depending on whether the skier is turning, the index is written lowercase in the case of a straight line and uppercase in the case of a turn. $F_{eff}$, the effective force acting on a skier that is descending on a straight line, is defined as

\begin{equation}
F_{eff}=F_{lat}-F_N
\end{equation}

If the skier is performing a carved turns then the effective force $F_{EFF}$ can be written as

\begin{equation}
F_{EFF}=F_{lat}-F_C-F_N
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{effective_force_pic} shows the effective force ($F_{eff}$ and $F_{EFF}$).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/figure6.eps}
    \caption{(from \cite{hol2012}) In (a) effective force during the descent on a straight line ($F_{eff}=F_{lat}-F_N$). In (b) effective force during a carved turn ($F_{EFF}=F_{lat}-F_N-F_C$)}\label{effective_force_pic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The kinetic friction force $F_{ground}$ can be expressed in terms of the skier's effective force as

\begin{equation}
F_{ground}=-\mu \norm{F_{eff}}e_{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}

when descending on a straight line. $mu$ is the kinetic friction coefficient of skis on snow. In the case of a turn

\begin{equation}
F_{GROUND}=-\mu \norm{F_{EFF}}e_{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}

The air drag force $F_{air}$ is antiparallel to the direction of motion $e_{\dot{r}}$ and is defined as

\begin{equation}
F_{air}=-\frac{1}{2}C_d \rho A \norm{\dot{r}}^2 e_{\dot{r}}
\end{equation}

where $C_d$ is the drag coefficient, $\rho$ the air density and $A$ the projected frontal area of the skier perpendicular to the direction of motion.

Finally, the net force $F_{net}$ accelerating the skier can be defined as

\begin{equation}
F_{net}=-F_P + F_{air} + F_{ground}
\end{equation}

if the skier is not turning. Otherwise the force is defined as

\begin{equation}
F_{NET}=-F_P + F_{AIR} + F_{GROUND} + F_C
\end{equation}


\section{Limitations}
The model proposed describes the motion of an expert skier that is performing perfect carved turns. The turning radio has been taken constant and equals to the sidecut radius of the skis. Not experienced skiers and other snow-sport athletes are not considered. An important limitation of the model is that it does not allow skiers to stop their descent.  Moreover skiers are not allowed to jump nor to exit the ski slope. If a skier collides with an edge of the slope it is reflected back with an angle equals to the angle at which he or she has collided.

\section{Differences from the original model}
The physical model of the skiers motion has been keep equals to the one exposed in \cite{hol2012}. Between the social forces, the destination force $F_D$ (see. \ref{destination_force}) is of critical importance. His action depends on  the selection of the waypoints. In the original paper the waypoints were selected randomly every 50m, using a uniform distribution on the corresponding line from the left
to the right edge of the slope (see fig.\ref{waypoints_old_pic}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/waypoint_line.eps}
    \caption{In \cite{hol2012} waypoints were selected randomly every 50m following a uniform distribution on the line from the left to the right edges of the slope.}\label{waypoints_old_pic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

A more dynamical approach in the selection of the waypoints has  been considered to better model the choices that a skier takes descending a slope.
